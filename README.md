# guard-user-mayhem

Code for the talk _Guard That App From User Mayhem_.

## Abstract

Users are chaos monkeys. They can navigate anywhere at any time in your application. Angular provides you with guards to protect the routing of your application. If you don’t use guards, you’re responsible when they click that link before saving after 15 minutes of data entry. Learn some of the powerful uses of guards, to keep your app better protected from mayhem like them.
